# Swift-4-and-Alamofire
This repository includes the networking files and the main view controller file that I used in my published app titled "Get the Gist". "Get the Gist" allows users to view the latest GitHub Gists, star and un-star Gists, and create their own Gists. It is currently a free app on the App Store. This app was written in Swift 4 and I used the networking library Alamofire.
